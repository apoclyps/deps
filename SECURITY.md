## Reporting a Vulnerability 

The deps team and community take all security vulnerabilities seriously. 
Thank you for improving the security of our open source  software. 
We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

Report security vulnerabilities by emailing the maintain of this project at:

The maintainer will acknowledge your email within 72 hours, and will send a more detailed response within 7 days indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the maintainer will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security vulnerabilities in third-party modules to the person or  team maintaining the module.

## Disclosure Policy

When the maintainer receives a security bug report, they will coordinate the fix and release process, involving the following steps:

  * Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
  * Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
  * Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes will be released as fast as possible to PyPi.
